        âœ‹ Hi there! I&apos;m a Brazilian who has been living in Brooklyn since 2015. With over fifteen years of
        experience in the software development industry, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work for large and small
        companies in the US and Brazil. I&apos;m currently Senior Software Engineer, Front-end at Upgrade.com.
        <br />
        <br />
        During my time in the US, I worked as an Engineering Manager at Salesforce Commerce Cloud for Commerce Search
        team until 2023. In 2014, I joined Loadsmart in its early stages and was the first front-end engineer, leading
        the area for five years. I was responsible for maintaining and evolving the engineering recruitment process and
        also worked as an engineering manager, managing teams, roadmap, backlog and supporting the career growth of two
        engineering teams.
        <br />
        <br />
        During my time in Brazil, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects. For five years, I worked on
        the design, development, and maintenance of highly scalable front-end applications for Globo.com, ge.globo.com,
        and sportv.globo.com. Globo is the largest media company in Latin America, and it was a fantastic experience to
        work with such a significant player in the industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before working at Globo.com, I spent almost three years working on various web development projects, e-learning
        platforms, and mentoring in coding bootcamp-like programs. It was fulfilling to work on these programs and help
        others develop their skills in the industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have already spoken at over 30 conferences about software development. In addition, I was a former
        co-organizer of some conferences for developers, including Front in BH, Front in Recife, PernambucoJS, and
        Rio.JS.
        <br />
        <br /> I am highly interested in building teams, Agile software development, Front-end development, Web
        Performance, Tests, and Web standards. I hold an MSc in Web Performance from PUC-Rio and a BSc in Computer
        Engineering from University of Pernambuco. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, visit coffeeshops and talking
        about travel.
