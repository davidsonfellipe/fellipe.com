          {/* <Experience>
            âœ‹ Hi there! I'm a Brazilian who has been living in Brooklyn since 2015. With over fifteen years of
            experience in the software development industry, I've had the opportunity to work for large and small
            companies in the US and Brazil. <br />
            <br />
            During my time in the US, I worked as an Engineering Manager at Salesforce Commerce Cloud for Commerce
            Search team until 2023. In 2014, I joined Loadsmart in its early stages and was the first front-end
            engineer, leading the area for five years. I was responsible for maintaining and evolving the engineering
            recruitment process and also worked as an engineering manager, managing teams, roadmap, backlog and
            supporting the career growth of two engineering teams.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my time in Brazil, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects. For five years, I worked
            on the design, development, and maintenance of highly scalable front-end applications for Globo.com,
            ge.globo.com, and sportv.globo.com. Globo is the largest media company in Latin America, and it was a
            fantastic experience to work with such a significant player in the industry.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before working at Globo.com, I spent almost three years working on various web development projects,
            e-learning platforms, and mentoring in coding bootcamp-like programs. It was fulfilling to work on these
            programs and help others develop their skills in the industry.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have already spoken at over 30 conferences about software development. In addition, I was a former
            co-organizer of some conferences for developers, including Front in BH, Front in Recife, PernambucoJS, and
            Rio.JS.
            <br />
            <br /> I am highly interested in building teams, Agile software development, Front-end development, Web
            Performance, Tests, and Web standards. I hold an MSc in Web Performance from PUC-Rio and a BSc in Computer
            Engineering from University of Pernambuco. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, visit coffeeshops and
            talking about travel.
